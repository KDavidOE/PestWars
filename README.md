# PestWars
This project is a tower defense game based on c# WPF.

There are 8 available buildings/units in the game and 4 different enemy types.
The objective is to defend the castle from the enemies while earning enough point to stay at the top of the leaderboard.

#TODO

-  Rework the synchron computing methods to asyncron.
-  Segment the rendering to multiple blocks to improve performance in later phases of the game.
-  Create animations to the movements.
